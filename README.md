A growing collection of hands-on AWS Cloud &amp; AI/ML projects. Built to learn, test, and showcase real-world skills.

# 🚀 Nova: My Cloud & AI/ML Journey

Welcome to my evolving footprint in the world of AWS Cloud and Artificial Intelligence.

This repository is where I build, test, and showcase real-world projects — one command, one service, and one model at a time. Every line of code reflects what I’ve learned hands-on from AWS tools, AI/ML workflows, and Python automation.

## 📘 My Learning Journey

I’m 48 years old, and this is the second chapter of my career — a deep dive into AI, cloud, and the power of lifelong learning.

My fascination with AI began when LLMs became publicly available. I wasn’t the “technical” person at the time, but I was drawn to how accessible AI made learning — how it felt like a **window into your soul without judgment**. AI became my teacher, motivator, and study partner — not a shortcut, but a guide.

Over the past year, I’ve studied relentlessly through Coursera and beyond:

- 🎓 **Prompt Engineering Specialization (Vanderbilt University)**  
- 🐍 **Python for Everybody (University of Michigan – 4 courses)**  
- 🧠 **AI Foundations (IBM – 3 courses)**  
- 🧬 **Deep Learning Specialization (Stanford – Prof. Andrew Ng)**  
- ☁️ **AWS Cloud & AI/ML Certification Prep**  
  - Currently building a 545-page AI/ML study guide: **“The AI/ML Bible”**

I’ve also explored cloud computing and am pursuing both the **Cloud Practitioner** and **ML Specialty** certifications from AWS.

## 🧪 Hands-On Projects

Alongside studying, I started building:

- 🧱 **Custom VPC + EC2 + Docker Setup** — a full AWS environment from scratch
- 🤖 **Sentiment Analysis AI Agent** using **CrewAI**, hardcoded from scratch
- 🪄 **No-code Multi-Agent Workflows** using **n8n + OpenAI**
- 📘 **The AI/ML Bible** — a structured, living document I will upload and open-source here

Now, I’m focused on **cloning real AWS GitHub repos**, breaking them down, rebuilding them from scratch, and documenting everything. My mission is simple: **Learn by building. Build to grow. Share to inspire.**

## 📈 The Mission

I don’t just study AI/Cloud — I **build it**.  
This repo is my **Nova** — a star rising from curiosity, discipline, and the belief that **it's never too late to learn**.

Let’s build. 🔥
